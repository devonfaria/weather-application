## Description

Welcome to the daily Weather Dashboard application! This application will allow you to search for a city, and retrieve current weather conditions and a 5-Day Forecast.

When you search a city, the javascript will attempt to pull the city coordinates from Open Weather API. If it is found, the application will begin fetching weather data to generate the HTML elements that appear on the right, and create a saved search button in the search bar. If not, it will show an error.

## Visuals

The following layout is what you can expect to see on your browser.

This is what you page should look like if there are cities in localStorage that has been searched previously.

## Contributions

A huge thank you to Sasha Peters for helping me determine how to properly load the HTML page with elements using a for loop, and for properly parsing the information when retrieving from localStorage. A savior, I say!
